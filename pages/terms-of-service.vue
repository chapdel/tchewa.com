            Individual rate rules, tax information, applicable charges and
            cancellation policies are displayed in the &ldquo;Review Reservation
            Details,&rdquo; &ldquo;Summary of Charges&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hotel
            Cancellation Policy&rdquo; sections on the room reservation page of
            the Site.<br /><br />If you plan to travel with your pet, we
            recommend that you confirm directly with the Property that they do,
            indeed, accept pets. tchewa accepts NO RESPONSIBILITY for an
            individual Property&apos;s pet policy.<br /><br />For non-US
            Properties, rates confirmed in USD may be converted to local
            currency by the Property at your time of stay, based on the exchange
            rate used by the Property and are subject to exchange rate
            fluctuations. Credit card charges are subject to additional currency
            conversions by banks or credit card companies, which are not within
            the Property&rsquo;s control and may impact the amount charged to
            your credit card.<br /><br />Reservations made by one or more
            individuals or by an agency on the Site, on behalf of one or more
            proposed guests, and involving more than nine (9) rooms at the same

            Some areas of our Sites are restricted to travel agents or other
            authorized representatives. The tchewa Information contained in
            such restricted areas is confidential to tchewa, and is provided
            for business use only, which includes reviewing commission status
            and statements, and enrolling in our Electronic Funds Transfer
            program as described below. We reserve the right to prohibit access
            to, or use of, these restricted areas where we determine that such
            use or access interferes with our Sites&rsquo; operations or that
            such use or access results in commercial benefits or other entities
            to our detriment. If you are a travel agent or authorized
            representative of a travel agent using our Sites, the following
            apply:<br /><br />Passwords: We have provided you with a unique
            password so that access to information related to your agency and
            transactions can be restricted to only those individuals to whom you
            provided the password. It is your responsibility to protect the
            confidentiality of the password. tchewa does not assume any
            liability for any access to information or transactions that are
            executed with the password provided to you. We strongly recommend
            that you change the password on a periodic basis and whenever a
            travel agent leaves your travel agency or you suspect that knowledge
            of the password is no longer limited to those whom you have
            authorized.<br /><br />Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT): tchewa may
            be able to make commission payments by electronic funds transfer
            (EFT) through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) System. If you
            complete the EFT registration process provided on our Sites,
            completion of the process signifies that you: (1) authorize tchewa
            to make payments by EFT; (2) certify that you have selected the
            designated depository institution and provided the correct account
            information; and (3) accept that all such EFTs will occur in
            accordance with the following: (i) you will give thirty (30)
            days&rsquo; advance notice to tchewa of any changes regarding your
            depository institution or other payment instructions; and (ii) you

            United States Department of Treasury. You agree to use all
            reasonable efforts not to arrange for any of these prohibited
            persons to stay at, use or tour any tchewa facilities.

            Our Sites contain information on tchewa products and services, not
            all of which are available in every location. A reference to a

          </p>
          <p>Governing Law</p>
          <p>
            These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by, construed and
            enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland,
            United States, without regard to its conflicts of law rules. The
            exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not covered by the terms of
            the Arbitration provision set forth in these Terms and Conditions
            may be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the
            State of Maryland, United States. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY
            NOW HAVE OR HEREAFTER POSSESS TO A TRIAL BY JURY. The foregoing
            shall not apply to the extent that applicable law in your country of
            residence requires application of another law and/or jurisdiction
            and this cannot be excluded by contract.
          </p>
          <p>Arbitration</p>
          <p>
            Except with respect to any claim or dispute involving the ownership,
            validity or use of any tchewa trademarks or service marks, any
            dispute arising out of or related to the Sites (including any claim
            that any provision of these Terms and Conditions are invalid,
            illegal, or otherwise voidable or void) will be submitted for and
            resolved by binding arbitration before the American Arbitration
            Association (AAA). tchewa shall have the right in a proper case to
            obtain temporary restraining orders, temporary or preliminary
            injunctive relief and/or declaratory relief (other than declarations
            with respect to the amount of money damages) from a court of
            competent jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arbitration proceedings shall be heard by one independent
            arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge. The
            arbitration shall be held in Bethesda, Maryland and in accordance
            with the then-existing Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. All
            matters within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1,
            et seq.) will be governed by it and not by any state arbitration
            law. You and tchewa waive any rights to maintain other available
            resolution processes for such disputes, such as a court action or
            administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. You and tchewa
            waive any right to a jury trial for such disputes. The rules in
            arbitration are different from the rules that apply in court. There
            is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can
            award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same
            limitations stated in these Terms and Conditions, as a court would.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reaching his or her decision, the arbitrator shall follow these
            Terms and Conditions, shall be bound to apply the applicable law and
            shall not rule inconsistently with the applicable law. The
            arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis, and not as a
            consolidated, common, representative, group or class. The arbitrator
            shall include in his or her award any relief he or she deems proper
            in terms of money damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from the
            date due at the maximum rate allowed by law), and attorneys&rsquo;
            fees and costs. The award of the arbitrator shall be conclusive and
            binding upon all parties hereto and judgment upon the award may be
            entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confidential.&nbsp;Other than as may be required by law, the entire
            arbitration proceedings (including, but not limited to, any rulings,
            decisions or orders of the arbitrator), shall remain confidential
            and not be disclosed to anyone other than the parties to this
            Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Limitations Period.&nbsp;Any and all claims and actions arising out
            of or relating to the sites shall be commenced within one (1) year
            from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claim or
            action, or such claim or action shall be barred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Class Action Waiver.&nbsp;You agree that you will not file a class
            action against tchewa or participate in a class action against
            tchewa. You agree that you will not file or seek a class
            arbitration, or participate in a class arbitration, against
            tchewa.
